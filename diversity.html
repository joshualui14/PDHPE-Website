	<h1>Cultural Diversity</h1>
		<p>Cultural diversity is the difference between various cultures that contribute towards society. This also involves the appreciation and recognition of these cultures and how they are present within our own lives and the community. Cultural diversity is extremely beneficial to the people within a society due to the larger exposure to different cultures, new experiences, a greater range of unique perspectives and insights and the removal of stereotypes. 

		This difference enables us to shape our identities with newly acquired knowledge that has been gathered from the various cultures that we are constantly exposed to. In addition, this assists with the removal of negative stereotypes against these people through the greater understanding of how their cultures function and act differently to our own.
		</p>

	<h2>Ways to Support Cultural Diversity</h2>

			<li>Interact with other cultures to gain a better understanding</li>
			<li>Accommodate people from other cultures with their specific needs</li>

			<li>Intervene within situations of racism</li>
			<li>Create comfortable spaces for the sharing of different ideas</li>
